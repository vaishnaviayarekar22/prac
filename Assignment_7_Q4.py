#Given two sets, set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50} and set2 = {30, 60, 70}, write Python code to perform the following operations and print the results:

#Union of set1 and set2
#Intersection of set1 and set2
#Difference  of set1 from set2 
#Symmetric difference of set1 and set2

set1 = {10,20,30,40,50}
set2 = {30,60,70}
print(set1.union(set2))
print(set1.intersection(set2))
print(set1.difference(set2))
print(set1.symmetric_difference(set2))
